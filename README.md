<h2>Music tracks classification projects</h2>
The problem addressed in this project is the classification of musical tracks into three energy level groups using a classification model. 
It aims to determine whether a track is not energetic, moderately energetic or energetic. 
The solution to this problem is based on data regarding various attributes of the track, such as key, loudness, speechiness, acousticness, instrumentalness, valence, danceability,
tempo, and also the musical genre to which the track can be assigned.
The project includes analysis and visualization of the collected data to gain insights into the relationship between various features and the energy level of the tracks.
<br>The data used for this project is obtained from the Spotify API. It includes information about the audio features of each track, as well as the track's author.
<br>This project was developed in 2023 as a part of the Systems Analysis and Decision Support Methods course.
